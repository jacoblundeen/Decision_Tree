# Decision Trees
This project implements the decision tree algorithm from scratch. This algorithm is able to handle both numerical and categorical data.

Features:
* Uses gain ratio for splitting criterion on categorical data
* Uses mean squared error for the splitting criterion on numerical data
* Reduced-error pruning can be used as an option for both implmentations
